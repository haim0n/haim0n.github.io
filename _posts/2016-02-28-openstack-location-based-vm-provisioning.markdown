# Real World Use Case - Emergency Breaklight In Autonomous Cars 
Normally, even an advanced driver assistance systems can only react to a direct surroundings of the vehicle.
With connected driving via `5G` mobile network, the cars will be able to communicate nearly in real time over a large distance
and provide driving information beyond the driver's line of sight. This will allow the car to slowdown in advance, in 
the case of an upcoming road hazard. 

A more advanced use case can be considered as well: two cars coordinating a lane change and negotiating the priority and risk of the 
situation, while taking into an account such parameters as speed, location, and 
weather conditions.

# The Challenge
Current mobile operators infrastructure is based on a central cloud, located at central data center. It means that all
data between mobile end user flows all the way up to the core data center and processed there. That way of communication 
between cars has an end to end latency of up to *seconds*, and this is untolerable for the use case.

*Car to car communication via central cloud introduces high latency*

# The Straightforward Solution 
The "simple" solution would be bringing the cloud infrastructure closer to the end users (cars) in our case. 
One of the possible ways to achieve that is being developed by ETSI and referred to as  
[mobile edge computing](http://www.etsi.org/technologies-clusters/technologies/mobile-edge-computing). It is described in 
the following section.
   
# Mobile Edge Computing To The Rescue
Mobile-edge Computing `(MEC)` enables *cloud* computing capabilities and an IT service environment within the Radio Access Network `(RAN)` in 
close proximity to mobile subscribers. Simply put, MEC architecture provides small data centers `(cloudlets)` nearer to 
mobile devices, sensors, and end users (cars in our case). These data centers are aimed to be located just one wireless 
hop away from the user at the radio access network RAN facilities which is reffered to as `network edges` i.e.; the nearest `base station`.
Compute and storage resources being right next to the user enables applications that require low latency responses.

#### MEC Main Components
The architecture consists of several parts:
 
* A high-bandwidth and low-latency optical transport network.

* A distributed wireless network comprised of a [remote radio Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_radio_head) 
`(RRU)` or remote radio head `(RRH)` and antennas.

* A centralized baseband unit `(BBU)` pool consisting of general purpose processors with Network Function Virtualization `(NFV)` support.
The BBU is a unit that processes baseband signals in telecomm systems. The BBU pool is built on open hardware, like 
x86/ARM CPU based servers, plus interface cards to handle fiber link to RRH and inter-connection in the pool.

* MEC server platform or simply `(MEC server)`, which is integrated at the RAN element. This server provides `virtual` 
computing resources, storage capacity, connectivity and access to RAN information. It supports a multitenancy run-time and hosting
environment for applications and services.

*Note*: in MEC world the BBU and RRU are being *virtualized* as well.

#### Zoom Into the MEC Server Platform
The MEC server platform consists of a hosting infrastructure and an application platform as described below:

*MEC server platform*

The MEC hosting infrastructure consists of hardware resources and a virtualization layer. The details of
the actual implementation of the MEC hosting infrastructure (including the actual hardware
components) are abstracted from the applications being hosted on the platform. 

* The MEC application platform provides the capabilities for hosting applications and consists of the
applicationâ€™s virtualization manager and application platform services.

* The `virtualization manager` supports multi-tenancy, run-time and hosting environment for applications by providing 
Infrastructure as a Service `(IaaS)` facilities. The IaaS provides a security and resource sandbox for the applications 
and the platform. Virtual-appliance applications run on top of an IaaS and are delivered as packaged-operating-system 
Virtual Machine (VM) images, allowing complete freedom of implementation.

* The MEC application-platform services provide a set of middleware application services and
infrastructure services to the applications hosted on the MEC platform:
    * Communication services
        * Service registry
        * Radio Network Information Services (RNIS)
    * Traffic Offload Function (TOF)

MEC applications from vendors, service providers, and third-parties are deployed and executed within
Virtual Machines. The MEC server and its services are application agnostic. The applications are
managed by their related Application Management Systems which are application-specific components.
Neither the applications nor their interfaces with the Application Management Systems are included in
the scope of the work of the MEC initiative. The application management capabilities do not include
application life-cycle management (e.g. start, stop, etc.), which is under the responsibility of the MEC
application platform management system. 

# Mobile Edge Computing And OpenStack
[OpenStack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack) is being the de facto software in IaaS virtualization platform world.
It is no wonder that it's one of the major candidates to fill in the MEC server platform virtualization manager slot. 
So for our case it is the block responsible for provisioning the resources required for the car to car communication
application.

The requirement for the infrastructure is to having the ability to dynamically adapt to for the application needs and scale 
the resources according to the requirements from it.

In the case of the autonomous cars it means that the application platform would be required
to scale and provision the cloudlet with resources when more car traffic hits the base station, and vise versa - remove 
those when traffic is low.

# Resource Provisioning At Physical Location




# Connecting Mobile Edge Computing And The Use Case
Adding mobile edge computing and geo service applications to the base stations makes communication much faster, so that
base stations with MEC cloudlets will show an end to end latency of a few **miliseconds**.

*Car to car communication via MEC cloudlet, reduces the latency by several magnitude orders*



# Nova Host Aggregates
A  [`host aggregate`][host-aggregates] is simply put, a group of hosts sharing some metadata. A host can be in more than one host aggregate. The concept of host aggregates is only exposed to cloud administrators.

A host aggregate may be exposed to users in the form of an `availability zone`. When you create a host aggregate, you have the option of providing an availability zone name. If specified, the host aggregate you have created is now available as an availability zone that can be requested upon provisioning.


Create a host aggregate that is exposed to users as an availability zone:
{% highlight bash %}
$ nova aggregate-create nyc-aggregate1 nyc:40.71:-74.00
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------+----------+
| Id | Name            | Availability Zone | Hosts | Metadata |
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------+----------+
| 1  | nyc-aggregate1  | nyc:40.71:-74.00  |       |          |
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------+----------+
{% endhighlight %}

Add a host to the newly created nyc host aggregate:
{% highlight bash %}
$ nova aggregate-add-host 1 host1
Aggregate 2 has been successfully updated.
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Id | Name            | Availability Zone | Hosts       | Metadata                                     |
+----+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------+
| 1  | nyc-aggregate   | nyc:40.71:-74.00  | [u'host1']  | {u'availability_zone': u'nyc:40.71:-74.00'}  |
+----+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+--------------------------------------------+
{% endhighlight %}

Now that the nyc availability zone has been defined and contains one host, we can create another zone for Austin, Tx:
{% highlight bash %}
$ nova aggregate-create txs-aggregate1 aus:30.26:-97.74
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------+----------+
| Id | Name            | Availability Zone | Hosts | Metadata |
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------+----------+
| 2  | txs-aggregate   | aus:30.26:-97.74  |       |          |
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------+----------+
{% endhighlight %}

And assigning a host to it:
{% highlight bash %}
$ nova aggregate-add-host 2 host2
Aggregate 2 has been successfully updated.
+----+-----------------+-------------------+-------------+---------------------------------------------+
| Id | Name            | Availability Zone | Hosts       | Metadata                                    |
+----+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------+
| 1  | txs-aggregate   | aus:30.26:-97.74  | [u'host1']  | {u'availability_zone': u'aus:30.26:-97.74 '}|
+----+-----------------+-------------------+---------------+-------------------------------------------+
{% endhighlight %}

In order for the proper location decision to be made - we need an orchestration logic, which is out of current scope, but
we can come up with a simplified one for our purpuse.

Assuming there are only two data centeres, a simple table can be created:

| Geo Corrdinates | Availability Zone|
|-----------------|------------------|
| 40.71:-74.00    | nyc:40.71:-74.00 |
| 30.26:-97.74    | aus:30.26:-97.74 |



Our location decision function does the following: 

* gets the user's location
* travels the table and for each entry calculates the distance
* returns a list of placement candidates
* attempts to boot an instance with specified `app1-instance` flavor

{% highlight bash %}
$ nova boot --flavor 84 --image 64d985ba-2cfa-434d-b789-06eac141c260 \
 --availability-zone nyc:40.71:-74.00 app1-instance
{% endhighlight %}
